_____ Basic Concepts _____

    Goal!
    You need to calculate the points earned by a soccer team.
    The team won 18 games and ended 7 games as a draw.
    A win brings 3 points, while a draw brings 1.
    Create a program to calculate and output the total points earned by the team.
        print(3*18+7)

    Do The Math
    Write a program that will multiply the sum of 5 and 6 by 57.3 and output the result.
    Remember that you can use parentheses to specify the order of operations.
        print((5 + 6) * 57.3)

    Exponentiation
    Write code to output 4 raised to the 5th power.
    Output the result using the print() statement.
        print(4**5)

    Flight Time (PROJECT)
    You need to calculate the flight time of an upcoming trip. You are flying from LA to Sydney, covering a distance of 7425 miles, the plane flies at an average speed of 550 miles an hour.
    Calculate and output the total flight time in hours.
    Hint
    The result should be a float.
    Use the print statement to output the result.
        distance = 7425
        speed = 550
        flight_time = float(distance / speed)
        print(flight_time)

_____ Strings _____

    Output The String
    You are given a code that should output a string with quotes.
    However, it contains errors.
    Task
    Fix the given code to generate the expected output.
    Remember, you need to escape the quotes in the strings to fix the errors in the code.
        print('I\'m learning Python. It\'s easy.')

    New Lines
    Write a program to output the letters A B C D, each on a separate line.
    You can use 3 quotes to add the new lines.
        print("""A
        B
        C
        D""")

    Hey There
    You’re given a task to write the word "hi" 42 times. Boring, right?
    Write a program to do it for you.
    Create a program to output "hi" 42 times, without any separators, on the same line.
    Remember, you can multiply strings by numbers.
        print("hi"*42)

    Leaderboard (PROJECT)
    You need to make a program for a leaderboard.
    The program needs to output the numbers 1 to 9, each on a separate line, followed by a dot:
    1.
    2.
    3.
    ...
    You can use the \n newline character to create line breaks, or, alternatively, create the desired output using three double quotes """.
        print("""1.
        2.
        3.
        4.
        5.
        6.
        7.
        8.
        9.""")

_____ Variables _____

    Value of The Variable
    The provided code stores the value 7 in a variable, and outputs it.
    Change the code to output the value of the variable raised to the power of 3.
        num = 7
        num = num ** 3
        print(num)

    Desired Output
    Somebody wrote code to take a string input and output it, repeated 10 times.
    However, the code results in an error.
    Fix the code to output the desired output.
        x = input()
        print(x*10)

    Convert The Input
    Write a program to take x and y as input and output the string x, repeated y times.
    Sample Input
    hi
    3
    Sample Output
    hihihi
    Remember to convert the input to the required data type.
        x = input()
        y = int(input())
        print(x * y)

    Tip Calculator (PROJECT)
    When you go out to eat, you always tip 20% of the bill amount. But who’s got the time to calculate the right tip amount every time? Not you that’s for sure! You’re making a program to calculate tips and save some time.
    Your program needs to take the bill amount as input and output the tip as a float.
    Sample Input
    50
    Sample Output
    10.0
    Explanation: 20% of 50 is 10.
    To calculate 20% of a given amount, you can multiply the number by 20 and divide it by 100: 50*20/100 = 10.0
        bill = int(input())
        bill = bill*.2
        print(bill)

_____ Control Flow _____

    At The Boiling Point
    Write a program that checks if the water is boiling.
    Take the integer temperature in Celsius as input and output "Boiling" if the temperature is above or equal to 100.
    Sample Input
    105
    Sample Output
    Boiling
    Do not output anything if the water is not boiling.
        temp = int(input())
        if temp > 99:
            print("Boiling")

    Face Control
    Write a program to control entrance to a club.
    Only people who are 18 or older are allowed to enter the club.
    Your program takes the age of the person who tries to enter, and outputs "Allowed" if they are allowed to enter the club, and "Sorry" if they are younger than the allowed age.
    Sample Input
    24
    Sample Output
    Allowed
        age = int(input())
        if age > 17:
         print("Allowed")
        else:
         print("Sorry")

    Age Groups
    Given the age of a person as an input, output their age group.
    Here are the age groups you need to handle:
    Child: 0 to 11
    Teen: 12 to 17
    Adult: 18 to 64
    Sample Input
    42
    Sample Output
    Adult
    Remember, you can use the Boolean and operator to combine conditions, like x>0 and x<20.
        age = int(input())
        if age <= 11:
            print("Child")
        elif age <= 17:
            print("Teen")
        else:
            print("Adult")

    Call It Even
    You are given a program that outputs all the numbers from 0 to 10.
    Change the code to make it output only the even numbers.
    Any integer that can be divided exactly by 2 is an even number.
        x = 0
        while x<=10:
            if x%2==0:
                print(x)
            x+=1

    Ticket Prices
    You are making a ticketing system.
    The price of a single ticket is $100.
    For children under 3 years of age, the ticket is free.
    Your program needs to take the ages of 5 passengers as input and output the total price for their tickets.
    Sample Input
    18
    24
    2
    5
    42
    Sample Output
    400
    There is one child under 3 among the passengers, so the total price of 5 tickets is $400.
        total = 0
        #your code goes here
        i = 1
        while i <= 5:
            age = int(input())
            if age > 3:
                total = total + 100
            i += 1
        print(total)

    BMI Calculator (PROJECT)
    Tracking your BMI is a useful way of checking if you’re maintaining a healthy weight. It’s calculated using a person's weight and height, using this formula: weight / height²
    The resulting number indicates one of the following categories:
    Underweight = less than 18.5
    Normal = more or equal to 18.5 and less than 25
    Overweight = more or equal to 25 and less than 30
    Obesity = 30 or more
    Let’s make finding out your BMI quicker and easier, by creating a program that takes a person's weight and height as input and outputs the corresponding BMI category.
    Sample Input
    85
    1.9
    Sample Output
    Normal
    Weight is in kg, height is in meters.
    Note, that height is a float.
        weight = int(input())
        height = float(input())
        bmi = weight / height**2
        if bmi < 18.5:
            print("Underweight")
        elif bmi < 25:
            print("Normal")
        elif bmi < 30:
            print("Overweight")
        else:
            print("Obesity")

_____ Lists _____

    Strings
    Write a program that takes an input string and outputs the 3rd character of the string.
        word = input()
        print(word[2])

    Bingo
    Given a list of numbers, output "bingo" if it contains the input number.
    Do not output anything if the number is not found.
        x = [42, 8, 7, 1, 0, 124, 8897, 555, 3, 67, 99]
        num = int(input())
        if num in x:
            print("bingo")

    List of Numbers
    for loops allow you to easily iterate through lists.
    Given a list of numbers, calculate their sum using a for loop.
    Output the sum after the loop.
        x = [42, 8, 7, 1, 0, 124, 8897, 555, 3, 67, 99]
        total = 0
        for z in x:
            total += z
        print(total)

    Date Picker
    You are creating a date picker for a website and need to output all of the years in a given period.
    Write a program that takes two integers as input and outputs the range of numbers between the two inputs as a list.
    The output sequence should start with the first input number and end with the second input number, without including it.
    Sample Input
    2005
    2011
    Sample Output
    [2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010]
    Convert a range object to a list and output it.
        a = int(input())
        b = int(input())
        dates = list(range(a,b))
        print(dates)

    The Last Character
    Write a program that takes a string as input and outputs the last character of that string.
    Remember, you can use negative indices to index lists.
        word =input()
        print(word[-1])

    Sum of Consecutive Numbers (PROJECT)
    No one likes homework, but your math teacher has given you an assignment to find the sum of the first N numbers.
    Let’s save some time by creating a program to do the calculation for you!
    Take a number N as input and output the sum of all numbers from 1 to N (including N).
    Sample Input
    100
    Sample Output
    5050
    Explanation: The sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 is equal to 5050.
    You can iterate over a range and calculate the sum of all numbers in the range.
    Remember, range(a, b) does not include b, thus you need to use b+1 to include b in the range.
        n = int(input())
        total = 0
        #your code goes here
        for x in range(n+1):
            total = total + x
        print(total)

_____ Functions _____

    Queue Management
    You are working on a queue management program.
    The queue is represented by a list.
    Write a program to take an input, add it to the end of the queue, and output the resulting list.
    The append() method can be used to add new items to the list.
        queue = ['John', 'Amy', 'Bob', 'Adam']
        queue.append(input())
        print(queue)

    Broken Keyboard
    Your friend sent you a message, however his keyboard is broken and types a # instead of a space.
    Replace all of the # characters in the given input with spaces and output the result.
    You can use the replace() function of a string to replace one substring with another.
        msg = input()
        print(msg.replace('#', ' '))

    Welcome, Sololearner!
    We have a function that outputs "Welcome, user" as it is called. We want to make it more personalized, so redesign the given function so that it will take the name of the user as input and output the welcome message with it.
    Sample Input
    Tommy
    Sample Output
    Welcome, Tommy
    Don't forget to indent the statement in the function.
        def welcome():
            name = input()
            print("Welcome, " + name)
        welcome()

    Call The Function
    The given program defines a function printBill(), which takes one string argument and outputs formatted text.
    You need to take the user input and call the function by passing the input as its argument.
    You need to only call the function, as it will take care of the output.
        def printBill(text):
            print("======")
            print(text)
            print("======")
        printBill(input())

    Area of a Rectangle
    We need to calculate the area of a given rectangle.
    Your program needs to take the width and length as input and output the area of the rectangle.
