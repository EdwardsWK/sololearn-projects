    You are working at a car dealership and store the car data in a dictionary:
    car = {
        'brand': 'BMW',
        'year': 2018,
        'color': 'red'
    } 
    Your program needs to take the key as input and output the corresponding value.
    Sample Input
    year
    Sample Output
    2018
    The data is already defined in the code.
        car = {
            'brand':'BMW',
            'year': 2018,
            'color': 'red',
            'mileage': 15000
        }
        print(car[input()])
        
    National Economic Freedom
    You are working on data that represents the economic freedom rank by country.
    Each country name and rank are stored in a dictionary, with the key being the country name.
    Complete the program to take the country name as input and output its corresponding economic freedom rank.
    In case the provided country name is not present in the data, output "Not found".
    Recall the get() method of a dictionary, that allows you to specify a default value.
        data = {
            'Singapore': 1,
            'Ireland': 6,
            'United Kingdom': 7,
            'Germany': 27,
            'Armenia': 34,
            'United States': 17,
            'Canada': 9,
            'Italy': 74
        }
        print(data.get(input(), "Not found"))
        
    Contact Search
    You are given a list of contacts, where each contact is represented by a tuple, with the name and age of the contact.
    Complete the program to get a string as input, search for the name in the list of contacts and output the age of the contact in the format presented below:
    Sample Input
    John
    Sample Output
    John is 31
    If the contact is not found, the program should output "Not Found".
        contacts = [
            ('James', 42),
            ('Amy', 24),
            ('John', 31),
            ('Amanda', 63),
            ('Bob', 18)
        ]
        name = input()
        for x in contacts:
            if name in x:
                print(str(x[0]) + " is " + str(x[1]))
                break
        else:
            print("Not found")
    
    Square Up
    Tuples can be used to output multiple values from a function.
    You need to make a function called calc(), that will take the side length of a square as its argument and return the perimeter and area using a tuple.
    The perimeter is the sum of all sides, while the area is the square of the side length.
    Sample Input
    3
    Sample Output
    Perimeter: 12
    Area: 9
    The given code takes a number from user input, passes it to the calc() function, and uses unpacking to get the returned values.
        def calc(x):
            #your code goes here
            return x * 4, x ** 2
        side = int(input())
        p, a = calc(side)
        print("Perimeter: " + str(p))
        print("Area: " + str(a))
    
    You Are Qualified!
    You are working on a recruitment platform, which should match the available jobs and the candidates based on their skills.
    The skills required for the job, and the candidate's skills are stored in sets.
    Complete the program to output the matched skill.
    You can use the intersect operator to get the values present in both sets.
        skills = {'Python', 'HTML', 'SQL', 'C++', 'Java', 'Scala'}
        job_skills = {'HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'C#', 'NodeJS'}
        print(list(skills & job_skills)[0])
        
    Ignore The Vowels
    Given a word as input, output a list, containing only the letters of the word that are not vowels.
    The vowels are a, e, i, o, u.
    Sample Input
    awesome
    Sample Output
    ['w', 's', 'm']
    Use a list comprehension to create the required list of letters and output it.
        word = input()
        vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
        a = [i for i in word if i not in vowels]
        print(a)    
    
    Letter Counter (PROJECT)
    Given a string as input, you need to output how many times each letter appears in the string.
    You decide to store the data in a dictionary, with the letters as the keys, and the corresponding counts as the values.
    Create a program to take a string as input and output a dictionary, which represents the letter count.
    Sample Input
    hello
    Sample Output
    {'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}
    You need to output the dictionary object.
    Note, that the letters are in the order of appearance in the string.
        text = input()
        dict = {}
        #your code goes here
        for i in text:
            dict[i]= text.count(i)
        print(dict)
    
_____ Functional Programming _____

    How Much?
    You are given code that should calculate the corresponding percentage of a price.
    Somebody wrote a lambda function to accomplish that, however the lambda is wrong.
    Fix the code to output the given percentage of the price.
    Sample Input
    50
    10
    Sample Output
    5.0
    The first input is the price, while the second input is the percentage we need to calculate: 10% of 50 is 5.0.
        price = int(input())
        perc = int(input())
        res = (lambda x,y:x*y/100)(price, perc)
        print(res)
    
    Getting A Raise
    You work on a payroll program.
    Given a list of salaries, you need to take the bonus everybody is getting as input and increase all the salaries by that amount.
    Output the resulting list.
    You can use the map() function to increase all the values of the list.
        salaries = [2000, 1800, 3100, 4400, 1500]
        bonus = int(input())
        def add_things(x):
            return x + bonus
        result = list(map(add_things,salaries))
        print(result)    
    
    Generating
    Finding prime numbers is a common coding interview task.
    The given code defines a function isPrime(x), which returns True if x is prime.
    You need to create a generator function primeGenerator(), that will take two numbers as arguments, and use the isPrime() function to output the prime numbers in the given range (between the two arguments).
    Sample Input
    10
    20
    Sample Output
    [11, 13, 17, 19]
    The given code takes the two arguments as input and passes them to the generator function, outputting the result as a list.
        def isPrime(x):
            if x < 2:
                return False
            elif x == 2:
                return True
            for n in range(2, x):
                if x % n ==0:
                    return False
            return True
        def primeGenerator(a, b):
            #your code goes here
            for number in range(a,b):
                if isPrime(number):
                    yield number
        f = int(input())
        t = int(input())
        print(list(primeGenerator(f, t)))
    
    Collecting Reports
    You are working on an invoicing system.
    The system has an already defined invoice() function, which takes the invoice number as argument and outputs it.
    You need to add a decorator for the invoice() function, that will print the invoice in the following format:
    Sample Input
    42
    Sample Output
    ***
    INVOICE #42
    ***
    END OF PAGE
    The given code takes the invoice number as input and passes it to the invoice() function.
        def decor(func):
            def wrap(num):
                print("***")
                func(num)
                print("***")
                print("END OF PAGE")
            return wrap
        @decor
        def invoice(num):
            print("INVOICE #" +num)
        invoice(input());
    
    Decimal to Binary
    The given code defines a recursive function convert(), which needs to convert its argument from decimal to binary.
    However, the code has an error.
    Fix the code by adding the base case for the recursion, then take a number from user input and call the convert() function, to output the result.
    Sample Input
    8
    Sample Output
    1000
    The binary representation of 8 is 1000.
        def convert(num):
            if num == 0:
                return 0
            return (num % 2 + 10 * convert(num // 2)) 
        a = int(input())
        print(convert(a))
    
    Making It Work
    The given code defined a function called my_min(), which takes two arguments and returns the smaller one.
    You need to improve the function, so that it can take any number of variables, so that the function call works.
    Remember, *args can be accessed inside the function as a tuple.
        def my_min(*args):
            return min(args)
            print(my_min(8, 13, 4, 42, 120, 7))

            def __init__(self, name, level):
                self.name = name
                self.level = level
            def intro(self):
                print(self.name + " (Level " + self.level + ")")
        #your code goes here
        name = input()
        level = input()
        p = Player(name,level)
        p.intro()
        
    Fine Art
    You are making a drawing application, which has a Shape base class.
    The given code defines a Rectangle class, creates a Rectangle object and calls its area() and perimeter() methods.
    Do the following to complete the program:
    1. Inherit the Rectangle class from Shape.
    2. Define the perimeter() method in the Rectangle class, printing the perimeter of the rectangle.
    The perimeter is equal to 2*(width+height)
        class Shape: 
            def __init__(self, w, h):
                self.width = w
                self.height = h
            def area(self):
                print(self.width*self.height)
        class Rectangle(Shape):
            #your code goes here
            def perimeter(self):
                print(2*(self.width + self.height))
        w = int(input())
        h = int(input())
        r = Rectangle(w, h)
        r.area()
        r.perimeter()
        
    Shape Factory
    We are improving our drawing application.
    Our application needs to support adding and comparing two Shape objects.
    Add the corresponding methods to enable addition + and comparison using the greater than > operator for the Shape class.
    The addition should return a new object with the sum of the widths and heights of the operands, while the comparison should return the result of comparing the areas of the objects.
    The given code creates two Shape objects from user input, outputs the area() of their addition and compares them.
    class Shape: 
        def __init__(self, w, h):
            self.width = w
            self.height = h
        def area(self):
            return self.width*self.height
        #your code goes here
        def __add__(self, other):
            return Shape(self.width + other.width, self.height + other.height)
        def __gt__(self, other):
            return self.area() > other.area()
    w1 = int(input())
    h1 = int(input())
    w2 = int(input())
    h2 = int(input())
    s1 = Shape(w1, h1)
    s2 = Shape(w2, h2)
    result = s1 + s2
    print(result.area())
    print(s1 > s2)
    
    Preservation
    We are working on a game. Our Player class has name and private _lives attributes.
    The hit() method should decrease the lives of the player by 1. In case the lives equal to 0, it should output "Game Over".
    Complete the hit() method to make the program work as expected.
    The code creates a Player object and calls its hit() method multiple times.
        class Player:
            def __init__(self, name, lives):
                self.name = name
                self._lives = lives
            def hit(self):
                #your code goes here
                self._lives -= 1
                if self._lives == 0:
                    print("Game Over")
        p = Player("Cyberpunk77", 3)
        p.hit()
        p.hit()
        p.hit()
        
    Define The Methods
    The given code takes 2 numbers as input and calls the static area() method of the Shape class, to output the area of the shape, which is equal to the height multiplied by the width.
    To make the code work, you need to define the Shape class, and the static area() method, which should return the multiplication of its two arguments.
    Use the @staticmethod decorator to define a static method.
        #your code goes here
        class Shape:
            def __init__(self, w, h):
                self.width = w
                self.heigh = h
            @staticmethod
            def area(width, height):
                return width * height
        w = int(input())
        h = int(input())
        print(Shape.area(w, h))
        
    Staying Alive
    We are improving our game and need to add an isAlive property, which returns True if the lives count is greater than 0.
    Complete the code by adding the isAlive property.
    The code uses a while loop to hit the Player, until its lives count becomes 0, using the isAlive property to make the condition.
        class Player:
            def __init__(self, name, lives):
                self.name = name
                self._lives = lives
            def hit(self):
                self._lives -= 1
            #your code goes here
            @property
            def isAlive(self):
                if self._lives > 0:
                    return True
        p = Player("Cyberpunk77", int(input()))
        i = 1
        while True:
            p.hit()
            print("Hit # " + str(i))
            i += 1
            if not p.isAlive:
                print("Game Over")
                break

    Shooting Game (PROJECT)
    You are creating a shooting game!
    The game has two types of enemies, aliens and monsters. You shoot the aliens using your laser, and monsters using your gun.
    Each hit decreases the lives of the enemies by 1.
    The given code declares a generic Enemy class, as well as the Alien and Monster classes, with their corresponding lives count.
    It also defines the hit() method for the Enemy class.
    You need to do the following to complete the program:
    1. Inherit the Alien and Monster classes from the Enemy class.
    2. Complete the while loop that continuously takes the weapon of choice from user input and call the corresponding object's hit() method.
    Sample Input
    laser
    laser
    gun
    exit
    Sample Output
    Alien has 4 lives
    Alien has 3 lives
    Monster has 2 lives
    The while loop stops when the user enters 'exit'.
        class Enemy:
            name = ""
            lives = 0
            def __init__(self, name, lives):

                if self.lives <= 0:
                    print(self.name + ' killed')
                else:
                    print(self.name + ' has '+ str(self.lives) + ' lives')
        class Monster(Enemy):
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__('Monster', 3)
            def hit(self):
                super().hit()
        class Alien(Enemy):
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__('Alien', 5)
            def hit(self):
                super().hit()
        m = Monster()
        a = Alien()
        while True:
            x = input()
            if x == 'exit':
                break
            elif x == 'laser':
                a.hit()
            elif x == 'gun':
                m.hit()

_____ Exceptions _____

    Cash Out
    An ATM machine takes the amount to be withdrawn as input and calls the corresponding withdrawal method.
    In case the input is not a number, the machine should output "Please enter a number".
    Use exception handling to take a number as input, call the withdraw() method with the input as its argument, and output "Please enter a number", in case the input is not a number.
    A ValueError is raised when you try to convert a non-integer to an integer using int().
        def withdraw(amount):
            print(str(amount) + " withdrawn!")
        #your code goes here
        n = input()

_____ Working With Files _____

    Reading Through
    You need to make a program to read the given number of characters of a file.
    Take a number N as input and output the first N characters of the books.txt file.
    The given code opens the books.txt file. Use the file object to read the content of the file.
        file = open("/usercode/files/books.txt")
        #your code goes here
        n = int(input())
        print(file.read(n))
        file.close()
        
    Filling Up With Numbers
    Take a number N as input and write the numbers 1 to N to the file "numbers.txt", each number on a separate line.
    Sample Input
    4
    Sample Output
    1
    2
    3
    4
    The given code reads the content of the file and outputs it.
    You can use \n to make line breaks.
    Do not forget to close the file after writing to it.
        n = int(input())
        file = open("numbers.txt", "w+")
        #your code goes here
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            file.write(str(i) + "")
        file.close()
        f = open("numbers.txt", "r")
        print(f.read())
        f.close()
        
    Book Club
    You are given a books.txt file, which includes book titles, each on a separate line.
    Create a program to output how many words each title contains, in the following format:
    Line 1: 3 words
    Line 2: 5 words
    ...
    Make sure to match the above mentioned format in the output.
    To count the number of words in a given string, you can use the split() function, or, alternatively, count the number of spaces (for example, if a string contains 2 spaces, then it contains 3 words).
        with open("/usercode/files/books.txt") as f:
            #your code goes here
            j = 1
            for line in f:
                print("Line " + str(j) + ": " + str(len(line.split(" "))) + " words")
                j+=1

    Title Encoder (PROJECT)
    You are given a file named "books.txt" with book titles, each on a separate line.
    To encode the book titles you need to take the first letters of each word in the title and combine them.
    For example, for the book title "Game of Thrones" the encoded version should be "GoT".
    Complete the program to read the book title from the file and output the encoded versions, each on a new line.
    You can use the .split() method to get a list of words in a string.
        file = open("/usercode/files/books.txt", "r")
        #your code goes here
        for x in file:
            title = x.split()
            for a in title:
                print(a[0],end="")
            print()
        file.close()

_____ Working With Strings _____

    How Many Vowels
    You need to make a program that counts the number of vowels in a given text.
    The vowels are a, e, i, o, and u.
    Take a string as input and output the number of vowels.
    Sample Input:
    this is great
    Sample Output:
    4
    There are 4 vowels in the given text.
        #your code goes here
        i = input()
        count = 0
        for w in i:
            if w=="a" or w=="e" or w=="i" or w=="o" or w=="u":
                count += 1
        print(count)

    Line Them Up
    Let's test your coding skills!
    Take a string as input and output each letter of the string on a new line, repeated N times, where N is the position of the letter in the string.
    Sample Input:
    data
    Sample Output:
    d
    aa
    ttt
    aaaa
    Hint: Use a loop to iterate over the string, keeping the position number of the current iteration in a variable. Then use multiplication to repeat the letters.
        #your code goes here
        word = input()
        print()
        i = 0
        while (i<len(word)):
            print(word[i]*(i+1))
            i+=1

    Editing Guide
    You are making a text editor and need to implement find/replace functionality.
    The code declares a text string. You need to take two string inputs, which represent the substring to find and what to replace it with in the text.
    Your program needs to output the number of replacements made, along with the new text.
    For example, for the given text "I weigh 80 kilograms. He weighs 65 kilograms.":
    Sample Input
    kilograms
    kg
    Sample Output
    2
    I weigh 80 kg. He weighs 65 kg.
    The program replaced 2 occurrences of the word kilograms with kg.
    Note, that you need to output the number of replacements, before the replaced text.
        text = "Amy has 128 dollars, while David has 54 dollars. Amy is going to the zoo. David watches soccer."
        a=input()
        b=input()
        print(text.count(a))
        print(text.replace(a,b))
        
    Letter Frequency (PROJECT)
    You are making a program to analyze text.
    Take the text as the first input and a letter as the second input, and output the frequency of that letter in the text as a whole percentage.
    Sample Input:
    hello
    l
    Sample Output:
    40
    Explanation : The letter l appears 2 times in the text hello, which has 5 letters. So, the frequency would be (2/5)*100 = 40.
    Division result is a float. Use the int() function to convert the result to an integer.
        #your code goes here
        stri = input()
        L = input()
        print(int(stri.count(L)/len(stri)*100))
        
_____ Lists _____

    Apple of My Eye
    You are given a 2D matrix, which represents the number of people in a room, grouped by their eye color and gender.
    The first row represents the male gender, while the second row represents females.
    The columns are the eye colors, in the following order: brown, blue, green, black
    data = [
         [23, 11, 5, 14],
        [8, 32, 20, 5]
    ] 
    The data shows that, for example, there are 20 green eyed females in the room (2nd row, 3rd column).
    Our program needs to take eye color as input and output the percentage of people with that eye color in the room.
    Sample Input:
    blue
    Sample Output:
    36
    Explanation: There are 11+32=43 people with blue eyes, which is 36% of the total.
    Note, that the output should be an integer: use the int() function to convert the result.
        data = [
    [23, 11, 5, 14],
    [8, 32, 20, 5]
    ]
        color = input()
        #your code goes here
        total = 118
        if color=="brown":
            print(int((data[0][0]+data[1][0])*100/total))
        elif color=="blue":
            print(int((data[0][1]+data[1][1])*100/total))
        elif color=="green":
            print(int((data[0][2]+data[1][2])*100/total))
        else:
            print(int((data[0][3]+data[1][3])*100/total))
            
    Fancy Houses
    You are analyzing house prices. The given code declares a list with house prices in the neighborhood.
    You need to calculate and output the number of houses that have a price that is above the average.
    To calculate the average price of the houses, you need to divide the sum of all prices by the number of houses.
    Use sum(list) to calculate the sum of all items in the list and len(list) to get the number of items.
        prices = [125000, 78000, 110000, 65000, 300000, 250000, 210000, 150000, 165000, 140000, 125000, 85000, 90000, 128000, 230000, 225000, 100000, 300000]
        #your code goes here
        avg = sum(prices)/len(prices)
        count = 0
        for i in prices:
            if i>avg:
                count += 1
        print(count)
        
    Insect Control
    The number of insects in a lab doubles in size every month.
    Take the initial number of insects as input and output a list, showing the number of insects for each of the next 12 months, starting with 0, which is the initial value.
    So, the resulting list should contain 12 items, each showing the number of insects at the beginning of that month.
    Sample Input:
    10
    Sample Output:
    [10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2560, 5120, 10240, 20480]
    Create a list comprehension to generate the required list.
    The formula to calculate the number of insects after N months will be: count*2ᴺ, where count is the initial number of insects.
        n = int(input())
        insects = [n*2**i for i in range(12)]
        print(insects)
        
    Average Word Length (PROJECT)
    Given a sentence as input, calculate and output the average word length of that sentence.
    To calculate the average word length, you need to divide the sum of all word lengths by the number of words in the sentence.
    Sample Input:
    this is some text
    Sample Output:
    3.5
    Explanation: There are 4 words in the given input, with a total of 14 letters, so the average length will be: 14/4 = 3.5
    Strings have a split() method, which returns the string split into a list, with the given separator. By default, the separator is a space, so calling split() will return a list containing the words of the string as items.
        text = input()
        words = text.split()
        total = sum(map(len,words))/len(words)
        print(total)
        
_____Dictionaries, Tuples, Sets_____

    Fuzzy Search
    You are making a phonebook. The contacts are stored in a dictionary, where the key is the name and the value is a list, representing the number and the email of the contact.
    You need to implement search: take the name of the contact as input and output the email.
    If the contact is not found, output "Not found".
    Note, that the email is the second element of the list.
        contacts = {
            "David": ["123-321-88", "david@test.com"],
            "James": ["241-879-093", "james@test.com"],
            "Bob": ["987-004-322", "bob@test.com"],
            "Amy": ["340-999-213", "a@test.com"]
        }
        #your code goes here
        name = input()
        if name in contacts:
            print(contacts[name][1])
        else:
            print("Not found")
            
    Mapping Software
    You are working on a mapping software. The map is stored as a list of points, where each item is represented as a tuple, containing the X and Y coordinates of the point.
    You need to calculate and output the distance to the closest point from the point (0, 0).
    To calculate the distance of the point (x, y) from (0, 0), use the following formula: √x²+y²
    You can iterate over the list and use tuple unpacking to get the x and y coordinates of each point: for (x, y) in points: and output the smallest value.
        points = [
            (12, 55),
            (880, 123),
            (64, 64),
            (190, 1024),
            (77, 33),
            (42, 11),
            (0, 90)
        ]
        #your code goes here
        distance = list(range(len(points)))
        z = 0
        import math
        for (x,y) in points:
            distance[z] = math.sqrt((x**2)+(y**2))
            z += 1
        print(min(distance))
        
    Words In Common
    Given two sentences, you need to find and output the number of the common words (words that are present in both sentences).
    Sample Input:
    this is some text
    I would like this tea and some cookies
    Sample Output:
    2
    The words 'some' and 'this' appear in both sentences.
    You can use the split() function to get a list of words in a string and then use the set() function to convert it into a set. For example, to convert the list x to a set you can use: set(x)
        s1 = input()
        s2 = input()
        list1 = s1.split()
        list2 = s2.split()
        print(len(set(list1)&set(list2)))
        
    Revenue Growth Analysis (PROJECT)
    You are analyzing sales data from a ticket office.
    The ticket for an adult is $20, while the ticket for a child under 18 is $5.
    The data you are given is in a dictionary format, where the keys are the sold ticket numbers, and the values are the customer ages.
    For example, "123-08": 24 means that the ticket was bought a 24 year old.
    Your goal is to calculate how much more money the office would make if it would change the ticket discount age to the given input.
    So, your program needs to take an integer as input and output the percentage of revenue growth, if the discount was given to people under that age.
    For example, if the office made $15000 with the original discount age, and would make $18000 with 14 as the discount age, then the growth would be ((18000-15000)/15000)*100 = 20%
    So, for the input 14, your program should output 20. The output should be an integer (use int() to convert the result).
    To iterate over the values of a dictionary, you can use the .values() function:
    for value in data.values()
        data = {
            "100-90": 25, "42-01": 48, "55-09": 12, "128-64": 71, "002-22": 18, "321-54": 19, "097-32": 33, "065-135": 64, "99-043": 80, "111-99": 11, "123-019": 5, "109-890": 72, "132-123": 27, "32-908": 27, "008-09": 25, "055-967": 35, "897-99": 44, "890-98": 56, "344-32": 65, "43-955": 59, "001-233": 9, "089-111": 15, "090-090": 17, "56-777": 23, "44-909": 27, "13-111": 21, "87-432": 15, "87-433": 14, "87-434": 23, "87-435": 11, "87-436": 12, "87-437": 16, "94-121": 15, "94-122": 35, "80-089": 10, "87-456": 8, "87-430": 40
        }
        age = int(input())
        #your code goes here
        data_values = data.values()
        total = 0You are given a dictionary that contains names and numbers of people.
You need to create a DataFrame from the dictionary and add an index to it, which should be the name values.
Then take a name from user input and output the row in the DataFrame, which corresponds to that row.
        stotal = 0
        for x in data_values:
            if x >= 18:
                total += 20
            else:
                total += 5
        for y in data_values:
            if y >= age:
                stotal += 20
            else:
                stotal += 5
        res = ((stotal-total)/total)*100
        print(int(res))

_____ User-Defined Data Structures _____

    Come Back
    You need to make a back button for a browser.
    You use a stack to store the website links visited. Each new link visited is pushed onto the stack.
    The back button needs to pop the top link from the stack and navigate to it.
    The given code declares a Browser class as a stack and implements some of its methods. Then, some links are pushed onto the stack.
    A while loop is then used to go back to all links and print them.
    Implement the required pop() method for the Browser, so that the given code works as expected.
    Note, that the pop() method needs to return the value, so that it can be printed.
        class Browser:
            def __init__(self):
                self.links = []    
                def is_empty(self):

        while not x.is_empty():
            print(x.pop())

    On A Call
    You are making a call center application, which should handle customers in a queue.
    The CallCenter class is implemented as a Queue. Each element of the queue has the topic of the call as its value. The two possible values are 'general' and 'technical'. A 'general' call takes on average 5 minutes to handle, while a 'technical' call requires 10 minutes.
    The given code adds multiple customers to the Queue from user input.
    You need to dequeue all added customers, calculate and output the total time required to handle all calls.
    Use a while loop to dequeue all the customers from the queue, until it is empty.
        class CallCenter:
            def __init__(self):
                self.customers = []

                return self.customers == []
            def add(self, x):
                self.customers.insert(0, x)
            def next(self):
                return self.customers.pop()
        c = CallCenter()

            if item == 'general':
                time += 5
            if item == 'technical':
                time += 10    
        print(time)
        
    Name That Tune
    You are making a Music Player, which allows you to create a playlist of tracks.
    The given code defines Player and Track classes, where the Player is a linked list, chaining together Track objects.
    The code takes a number of tracks from user input and adds them to the playlist.
    You need to iterate over the linked list and output all the tracks in the playlist in the order of playback.
    Use a while loop to iterate over the linked list.
        class Track:
            def __init__(self, title, next):
                self.title = title

            def add(self, title):
                if not self.head:
                    self.head = Track(title, None)
                    return
                curr = self.head
                while curr.next:
                    curr = curr.next
                curr.next = Track(title, None)
        p = Player()
        while True:
            x = input()

                            a += 1
            print(a)

    Balanced Parentheses (PROJECT)
    Parentheses are balanced, if all opening parentheses have their corresponding closing parentheses.
    Given an expression as input, we need to find out whether the parentheses are balanced or not.
    For example, "(x+y)*(z-2*(6))" is balanced, while "7-(3(2*9))4) (1" is not balanced.
    The problem can be solved using a stack.
    Push each opening parenthesis to the stack and pop the last inserted opening parenthesis whenever a closing parenthesis is encountered.
    If the closing bracket does not correspond to the opening bracket, then stop and say that the brackets are not balanced.
    Also, after checking all the parentheses, we need to check the stack to be empty -- if it's not empty, then the parentheses are not balanced.
    Implement the balanced() function to return True if the parentheses in the given expression are balanced, and False if not.
    Sample Input:
    (a( ) eee) )
    Sample Output:
    False
    You can use a simple list for a stack. Use list.insert(0, item) to push on the stack, and list.pop(0) to pop the top item. You can access the top element of the stack using list[0].
        def balanced(expression):
            #your code goes here
            count = 0
            for char in expression:
                if char == "(":
                    count += 1
                elif char == ")":
                    if count == 0:
                        return False
                    count -= 1
            return count == 0
        print(balanced(input()))

_____ Introduction _____

    Vaccinations Report
    We have a report on the number of flu vaccinations in a class of 20 people.
    It has the following numbers:
    never: 5
    once: 8
    twice: 4
    3 times: 3
    What is the mean number of times those people have been vaccinated?
    Output the result using the print() statement.
    Hint: Think about the data this way: it contains 20 values, each representing the number of vaccinations the corresponding person had.
        vac_nums = [0,0,0,0,0,
            1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,
            2,2,2,2,
            3,3,3
            ]
        #your code goes here
        mean = sum(vac_nums) / len(vac_nums)
        print(mean)
        
    Vaccinations Dataset
    Using the same vaccinations dataset, which includes the number of times people got the flu vaccine.
    The dataset contains the following numbers:
    never: 5
    once: 8
    twice: 4
    3 times: 3
    Calculate and output the variance.
    We will soon learn about easier ways to calculate the variance and other summary statistics using Python. For now, use Python code to calculate the result using the corresponding equation.
    Hint: The variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean.
        vac_nums = [0,0,0,0,0,
            1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,

_____ Math Operations With NumPy _____

    Houses On The Block
    You are given an array that holds the square footage data for houses on a particular street.
    A new house has just been constructed on that street.
    Modify your program to take the new house value as input, add it to the array, and output the array sorted in ascending order.
    Use the print statement to output the array object.
        import numpy as np
        data = np.array([1000, 2500, 1400, 1800, 900, 4200, 2200, 1900, 3500])
        data = np.append(data,int(input()))
        data = np.sort(data)
        print(data)
        
    Take Your Seat
    You are given an array that represents the occupancy of seats in a movie theater. A seat marked with 1 is occupied, while one marked 0 means the seat is free.
    However, the array is flat and 1-dimensional. Transform it into a 2-dimensional array, representing the rows of the seats.
    Each row in the theater has 5 seats and there are a total of 30 seats.
    Reshape the array into the corresponding shape and output the row at the given index, which is taken from user input.
    The row index is taken from user input in the given code.
    import numpy as np
    data = np.array([1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0])
    row = int(input())
    data = data.reshape(6,5)
    print(data[row])
    
    Array of Numbers
    You are given a task to find all of the whole numbers below 100 that are multiples of both 3 and 5.
    Create an array of numbers below 100 that are multiples of both 3 and 5, and output it.
    You can use the modulo operator % to check if a number is a multiple of another number.
        import numpy as np
        data = np.arange(1, 100)
        data = data[(data%3 == 0) & (data%5 == 0)]
        print(data)

        counter = 0
        for i in data:
            if i>mean:
                counter += 1
        print(counter)
        
    House Prices (PROJECT)
    You are given an array that represents house prices.
    Calculate and output the percentage of houses that are within one standard deviation from the mean.
    To calculate the percentage, divide the number of houses that satisfy the condition by the total number of houses, and multiply the result by 100.

        low = mean - std
        high = mean + std
        print(len(data[(low < data) & (data < high)]) / len(data) * 100)
        
_____ Data Manipulation With Pandas _____

Locating Contacts
    You are given a dictionary that contains names and numbers of people.
    You need to create a DataFrame from the dictionary and add an index to it, which should be the name values.
    Then take a name from user input and output the row in the DataFrame, which corresponds to that row.
        import pandas as pd
        data = {
            'name': ['James', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Amy', 'Tom'],
            'number': ['1234', '5678', '2222', '1111', '0909']
        }
        df = pd.DataFrame(data, index = ["James", "Billy", "Bob", "Amy", "Tom"])
        name = input()
        print(df.loc[name])

    Names and Ranks
    You are given a DataFrame that includes the names and ranks of people.
    You need to take a rank as input and output the corresponding name column from the DataFrame as a Series.
    Note that the rank is an integer, so you need to convert the user input to an integer.
        import pandas as pd
        data = {
             'name': ['James', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Amy', 'Tom', 'Harry'],
             'rank': [4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 6]
        }
        df = pd.DataFrame(data, index=data['name'])
        userrank = int(input())
        print(df["name"][df["rank"] == userrank])
        
    Cases and Deaths
    You are working with the 'ca-covid' CSV file that contains the COVID-19 infection data in California for the year 2020.
    The file provides data on daily cases and deaths for the entire year.
    Find and output the row that corresponds to December 31, 2020.
    The requested date is the last row in the dataset, so you can use indexing to select it.
        import pandas as pd
        df = pd.read_csv("/usercode/files/ca-covid.csv")
        df.set_index('date', inplace=True)
        df.drop('state', axis=1, inplace=True)
        print(df.iloc[-1])

    Day of The Week
    You continue working with the COVID dataset for California.
    Now, add the weekday names for each row as a new column, named 'weekday'.
    Then, output the last 7 days data of the dataset.
    Do not set any index on the DataFrame.
    The given code converts the date column to datetime, so you do not need to change its format.
    Use the .dt.strftime("%A") function on the date column to convert it into a weekday name.
        import pandas as pd
        df = pd.read_csv("/usercode/files/ca-covid.csv")
        df.drop('state', axis=1, inplace=True)
        df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'], format="%d.%m.%y")
        df['weekday'] = df['date'].dt.strftime("%A")
        print(df[-7:])

    Number of Cases
    Given the COVID data, find the day with maximum cases in a given month.
    Take a month name as input and output the row that corresponds to the day with the maximum number of cases in that month.
    You can filter the DataFrame for the given month first, and then select the row with the maximum cases.
    Important: The output should be a DataFrame, which includes all the columns.
    For example, for the month of February, the expected result would be:
        cases deaths month
        date
        2020-02-26 15 0 February 
    The given code adds a month column to the dataset, and adds an index. Do not change that part of the code.
        import pandas as pd
        df = pd.read_csv("/usercode/files/ca-covid.csv")
        df.drop('state', axis=1, inplace=True)
        df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'], format="%d.%m.%y")
        df['month'] = df['date'].dt.month_name()
        df.set_index('date', inplace=True)
        monthuser = input()
        maxim = df[df["month"]==monthuser]['cases'].max()
        print(df[df['cases']==maxim])
        
    COVID Data Analysis (PROJECT)
    You are working with the COVID dataset for California, which includes the number of cases and deaths for each day of 2020.
    Find the day when the deaths/cases ratio was largest.
    To do this, you need to first calculate the deaths/cases ratio and add it as a column to the DataFrame with the name 'ratio', then find the row that corresponds to the largest value.
    Important: The output should be a DataFrame, containing all of the columns of the dataset for the corresponding row.
        import pandas as pd
        df = pd.read_csv("/usercode/files/ca-covid.csv")
        df.drop('state', axis=1, inplace=True)
        df.set_index('date', inplace=True)
        df['ratio'] = df['deaths'] / df['cases']
        print (df[df['ratio'] == df['ratio'].max()])

===== PYTHON CORE (https://www.sololearn.com/certificates/CT-YRMUP5CS) =====
_____ Basic Concepts _____

    Your First Program
    Write a program to print "Python is fun".
    Note that the sentence starts with a capital letter.
    Hint
    Use print() function.
    Remember to enclose the text into single or double quotes.
        #output "Python is fun"
        print("Python is fun")

    Brain Freeze!
    Today is a holiday at the children's camp, so all the children will be served ice cream.
    There are 68 children in the group, and each child should get 2 scoops of ice cream.
    Task
    Write a program to calculate and output the total number of ice cream scoops we need.
    Use the multiplication operator * inside the print() function.
        #your code goes here
        print(68*2)
        
    How Many Miles?
    Calculate and output the number of miles in 1000 kilometers.
    Hint
    One mile is 1.6 kilometers, so find the quotient of 1000 and 1.6.
    Use the floor division operator //.
        #your code goes 
        print(1000//1.6)

    Exponentiation (PROJECT)
    Task:
    Write a program to calculate the amount that will result from the doubling to understand which choice results in a larger amount.
    Hint:
    Let's see how exponentiation can be useful to perform the calculation.
    For example, if we want to calculate how much money we will have on the 5th day, we can use this expression: 0.01*(2**5) = 0.32 dollars (multiply the penny by 2 raised to the power of 5).
    Use the print statement to output the resulting amount.
        # your code goes here
        print(0.01*(2**30))
        
 _____ Strings & Variables _____
 
    I Code
    Fix the given code to output I'm a programmer.
    Hint
    Escape the single quote inside the string.
    Use backslash \ for escaping.
        print('I\'m a programmer')
        
    More Lines, More Better
    Working with strings is an essential programming skill.
    Task
    The given code outputs A B C D (each letter is separated by a space).
    A
    B
    C
    D
    You can use either \n or three quotes to add new lines inside the given string.
        print('A\nB\nC\nD')
    
    String Operations
    The provided code outputs the string "ni".
        print("ni")
    Task:
    Modify the code to output the string repeated 3 times, and add an ! (exclamation mark) at the end of the output.
    Remember, you can concatenate strings using the + operator.
        print("ni"*3+"!")
    
    Fun With Exponents
    The provided code stores the value 7 in a variable, and outputs it.
    Task
    Change the code to output the value of the variable raised to the power of 3.
    Exponentiation can be used to raise a number to the power of another.
        x = 7 ** 3
        print(x)
        
    Multiple Variables
    You can use multiple variables to take multiple inputs for your program.
    For example, the following code takes two inputs and stores them in the variables x and y:
        x = input()
        y = input()
    Task:
    Given the code above, output the input x repeated y times.
    Sample Input:
    awesome
    3
    Sample Output:
    awesomeawesomeawesome
    Remember, the input() function results in a string. You need to convert the result into the corresponding type, if you need to use it as a number.
        x = input()
        y = int(input())
        print(x*y)

    Simple Calculator (PROJECT)
    Write a program to take two integers as input and output their sum.
    Sample Input:
    2
    8
    Sample Output:
    10
    Remember, input() results in a string.
        # your code goes here
        x = int(input())
        y = int(input())
        print(x + y)

_____ Control Structures _____

    Boiling
    Do not output anything if the water is not boiling.
        temp = int(input())
        # your code goes here
        if temp >= 100:
            print("Boiling")
    
    Club Bouncer Code
    Write a program to control entrance to a club.
    Only people who are 18 or older are allowed to enter the club.
    The given program takes the age and the name of the person who tries to enter. Complete the program to output "Welcome" followed by the name of the person if they are allowed to enter the club, and "Sorry" if they are younger than the allowed age.
    Sample Input
    24
    James
        age = int(input())
        name = input()
        # your code goes here
        if age >= 18:
            print("Welcome " + name)
        else:
            print("Sorry")

    Humidity Level
    The comfortable relative humidity for humans is between 40% and 60%.
    The given program takes the percent of humidity as input.
    Task
    Complete the code to output "norm" if the taken percent of humidity is in the range of 40 and 60 inclusive.
    Don't output anything otherwise.
    Sample Input
    45
    Sample Output
    norm
    Use the and operator to chain the conditions in the if statement.
        humidity = int(input())
        #your code goes here
        if humidity >= 40 and humidity <= 60:
            print("norm")
            
    Financial Transactions
    Using an ATM, customers can access their bank deposits or credit accounts to do a variety of financial transactions.
    You serve ATMs that accept only Visa and Amex bank cards.
    The given program takes the type of a bank card as input.
    Task
    Complete the program to output "accepted" if the card is Visa or Amex.
    Don't output anything otherwise.
    Sample Input
    Amex
    Sample Output
    accepted
    Use the or operator in the if statement to handle the conditions properly.
        type = input()
        #your code goes here
        if type == "Amex" or type == "Visa":
            print("accepted")

    Fruit Vending Machine
    Imagine a vending machine that sells fruits. Each fruit has its own number, starting from 0.
    Write a program for the vending machine, which will take n number as input from the customer and return the fruit with that index.
        fruits = ["apple", "cherry", "banana", "kiwi", "lemon", "pear", "peach", "avocado"] 
    If n< 0 or n>7 (the index of last fruit ), the program outputs "Wrong number".
    Sample Input:
    2
    Sample Output:
    banana
    Remember that the first element of the list has 0 index.
        fruits = ["apple", "cherry", "banana", "kiwi", "lemon", "pear", "peach", "avocado"]
        num = int(input())
        #your code goes here
        if num < 0 or num > 7:
            print("Wrong number")
        else:
            print(fruits[num])

    Bingo
    Given a list of numbers, output "bingo" if it contains the input number.
    Do not output anything if the number is not found
        items = [42, 88, 721, 12, 43, 22, 908]
        num = int(input())
        #your code goes here
        if num in items:
            print("bingo")
    
    The Middle Element
    Given a list, calculate the middle element's index.
    You can use the len() function to get the number of elements in the list and then floor divide it by 2 using two slashes (//).
        items = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]
        #your code goes here
        print((len(items))//2)
    
    Let's Do Some Magic
    You have a magic box that doubles the count of items you put, in every day.
    The given program takes the initial count of the items and the number of days as input.
    Task
    Write a program to calculate and output items' count on the last day.
    Sample Input
    3
    2
    Sample Output
    12
    Explanation
    Day 1: 6 (3*2)
    Day 2: 12 (6*2)
    Use *= operator to multiply the count of the items by 2 in each iteration.
        items = int(input())
        days = int(input())
        #your code goes here
        while days > 0:
            items *= 2
            days -= 1
        print(items)
        
    Iteration
    for loops allow you to easily iterate through lists.
    Given a list of numbers, output their sum.
    Sample Input
    1 3 7 5
    Sample Output
    16
    Output the sum after the loop.
        list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        sum = 0
        #your code goes here
        for i in list:
            sum += i
        print(sum)
        
    Date Picker
    You are making a date picker for a website and need to output all the years in a given period.
    Write a program that takes two integers as input and outputs the range of numbers between the two inputs as a list.
    The output sequence should start with the first input number and end with the second input number, without including it.
    Sample Input
    2005
    2011
    Sample Output
    [2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010]
    You can convert a range object to a list and output it.
        a = int(input())
        b = int(input())
        #your code goes here
        print(list(range(a,b)))

    FizzBuzz (PROJECT)
    FizzBuzz is a well known programming assignment, asked during interviews.
    The given code solves the FizzBuzz problem and uses the words "Solo" and "Learn" instead of "Fizz" and "Buzz".
    It takes an input n and outputs the numbers from 1 to n.
    For each multiple of 3, print "Solo" instead of the number.
    For each multiple of 5, prints "Learn" instead of the number.
    For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, output "SoloLearn".
    You need to change the code to skip the even numbers, so that the logic only applies to odd numbers in the range.
    Remember, the continue statement can be used to skip a loop iteration.
        n = int(input())
        for x in range(1, n,2):
            if x % 3 == 0 and x % 5 == 0:
                print("SoloLearn")
            elif x % 3 == 0:
                print("Solo")
            elif x % 5 == 0:
                print("Learn")
            else:
                print(x)

_____ Functions & Modules _____

    Welcome, SoloLearner!
    We have a function that outputs "Welcome, user" as it is called. We want to make it more personalized, so redesign the given function so that it will take the given input as the name of the user and output the welcome message with it.
    Sample Input
    Tommy
    Sample Output
    Welcome, Tommy
    Don't forget to call the function.
        def welcome_message():
            #redesign this function
            name = input()
            print("Welcome, " + name)
        welcome_message()

    Matching Passwords
    You are given a program with two inputs: one as password and the second one as password repeat. Complete and call the given function to output "Correct" if password and repeat are equal, and output "Wrong", if they are not.
    Sample Input
    nfs1598
    nfs1598
    Sample Output
    Correct
    Don't forget to add arguments when you call the function.
        password = input()
        repeat = input()
        def validate(text1, text2):
            #your code goes here
            if text1 == text2:
                print("Correct")
            else:
                print("Wrong")    
        validate(password, repeat)

    Hashtag Generator
    We are creating our own social network application and need to have a hashtag generator program.
    Complete the program to output the input text starting with the hashtag (#).
    Also, if the user entered several words, the program should delete the spaces between them.
    Sample Input
    code sleep eat repeat
    Sample Output
    #codesleepeatrepeat
    Hint
    You can use the replace() function to replace the spaces (" ") with empty strings (""). See how it works:
    s = "I like pears"
    s1 = s.replace("pears", "apricots")
    print(s1)
    #prints I like apricots
        s = input()
        def hashtagGen(text):
            #your code goes here
            taggy = "#" + text.replace(" ", "")
            return taggy
        print(hashtagGen(s))

    No Dice? No Problem
    Two friends want to play backgammon, but have lost the dice.
    Create a program to replace the dice. When the program is run, it should roll the dice and output the result of each die.
    Hint
    Use random.randint() function to generate random values in the range of 1 to 6 for each dice.
    You will see a random.seed(int(input())) line in sample code. It initializes the pseudorandom number generator and, in this case, ensures functionality of test cases.
        import random
        random.seed(int(input())) #please don't touch this lane
        #generate the random values for every dice
        dice1 = random.randint(1,6)
        dice2 = random.randint(1,6)
        print(dice1)
        print(dice2)

    Celcius To Farenheit Converter (PROJECT)
    You are making a Celsius to Fahrenheit converter.
    Write a function to take the Celsius value as an argument and return the corresponding Fahrenheit value.
    Sample Input

    Sample Output
    96.8
    The following equation is used to calculate the Fahrenheit value: 9/5 * celsius + 32
        celsius = int(input())
        def conv(c):
            #your code goes here
            return (9/5) * c + 32
        fahrenheit = conv(celsius)
        print(fahrenheit)

_____ Exceptions & Files _____

    Bank Card PIN System
    We need to create a program that allows users to create their own PIN codes for their bank cards. Each PIN code consists of digits. Complete the program so that when the user enters a character, the program stops and outputs "Please enter a number" and when the user enters only digits, the program outputs "PIN code is created".
    Sample Input
    44a5
    Sample Output
    Please enter a number
    Recall int() function, that occurs an error when the argument is not a number.
        pin = input()
        try:
            #your code goes here
            int(pin)
            print("PIN code is created")
        except ValueError:
            #and here
            print("Please enter a number")
            
    Making Coffee
    A coffee vending machine makes 5 types of coffee:
        coffee = ["Café Latte", "Caffe Americano", "Espresso", "Cappuccino", "Macchiato"] 
    Each coffee option has its own number, starting with 0. Write a program that will take a number from the customer as input from the customer and serve the corresponding coffee type. If the customer enters a number that is out of the accepted range, the program should output "Invalid number". Regardless of coffee option result, the program should output "Have a good day" at the end.
    Sample Input
    7
    Sample Output
    Invalid number
    Have a good day
    Remember, that the first element of the list has 0 index.
        coffee = ["Café Latte", "Caffe Americano", "Espresso", "Cappuccino", "Macchiato"]
        choice = int(input())
        try:
            #your code goes here
            print(coffee[choice])
        except:
            #and here
            print("Invalid number")
        finally:
            #and finally here
            print("Have a good day")
            
    Getting In Shape
    Tom has done pull ups every day and recorded his results. He recorded each day's results in a new line, so that each line represents each day he has done pull ups.
    Create a program that takes n number as input and outputs the n-th days result (starting from 0).
    Sample Input
    4
    Sample Output
    Day 4, 9 pull ups
    Recall the readlines() function that returns a list containing each line in the file as a list item.
        file = open("/usercode/files/pull_ups.txt")
        n = int(input())
        #your code goes here
        list = file.readlines()
        print(list[n])
        file.close()

    New Lines
    You are given the following list:
        names = ["John", "Oscar", "Jacob"] 
    Complete the program to create a file where you write the names from the list, each on a new line, and separately output them.
    Output
    John
    Oscar
    Jacob
    Remember that "\n" represents a new line.
        names = ["John", "Oscar", "Jacob"]
        file = open("names.txt", "w+")
        #write down the names into the file
        for i in names:
            file.write(i + "\n")
        file.close()
        file= open("names.txt", "r")
        #output the content of file in console
        print(file.read())
        file.close()
        
    Book Titles (PROJECT)
    You have been asked to make a special book categorization program, which assigns each book a special code based on its title.
    The code is equal to the first letter of the book, followed by the number of characters in the title.
    For example, for the book "Harry Potter", the code would be: H12, as it contains 12 characters (including the space).
    You are provided a books.txt file, which includes the book titles, each one written on a separate line.
    Read the title one by one and output the code for each book on a separate line.
    For example, if the books.txt file contains:
    Some book
    Another book
    Your program should output:
    S9
    A12
    Recall the readlines() method, which returns a list containing the lines of the file.
    Also, remember that all lines, except the last one, contain a \n at the end, which should not be included in the character count.
        file = open("/usercode/files/books.txt", "r")
        for line in file:
            if line[-1] == "\n":
                print(line[0] + str(len(line)-1))
            else:
                print(line[0] + str(len(line)))
        #your code goes here
        file.close()

        #your code goes here
        print(store["Apple"])

    Where's The Book?
    You can use the .get() method to find keys in a dictionary, and use a second parameter to return a default value, in case the key is not found.
    Rewrite the given code to use the .get() method instead of the if/else statements.
    Also, change the output to "Book not found", when the book is not found.
    Note how much shorter the resulting code is, compared to the if/else statement.
        books = {
            "Life of Pi": "Adventure Fiction", 
            "The Three Musketeers": "Historical Adventure",

    Tuples
    You are given coordinates of 2 points and need to find the straight line distance between them.
    The coordinates are provided in a tuple, for example:
        p = (8, 11) 
    The first value represents the x coordinate, while the second value represents the y coordinate of the point p.
    Complete the provided code to calculate and output the distance between the two given points.
    The linear distance is the square root of the square of the horizontal distance plus the square of the vertical distance between two points.
    The math.sqrt() function can be used to calculate the square root.
        import math
        p1 = (23, -88)
        p2 = (6, 42)
        res = math.sqrt(((p1[0] - p2[0])**2) + ((p1[1] - p2[1])**2))
        print(res)
        
    List Slices

    The __add__ method allows for the definition of a custom behavior for the + operator in our class.
    The provided code is trying to add together two BankAccount objects, which should result in a new object with the sum of the balances of the given accounts.
    Fix the code to make it work as expected and output the resulting account balance.
    The __add__ method needs to take 2 parameters, which represents the objects you are adding.
        class BankAccount:
            def __init__(self, balance):
                self.balance = balance
            def __add__(self, other):
                return BankAccount(self.balance + other.balance)
        a = BankAccount(1024)
        b = BankAccount(42)
        result = a + b
        print(result.balance)

    Making A Deposit
    You are given a BankAccount class and need to add a deposit() method to it, which adds the given amount to the private balance property.
    The code should declare a BankAccount object with an initial balance of 0, take a number from user input, add it to the balance using the deposit() method, and output the object.
    Complete the required deposit() method so the code works as expected and produces the required output.
    Remember, the methods in a class need to have self as their first parameter, which is used to access the properties.
        class BankAccount:
            def __init__(self, balance):
                self._balance = balance
            def __repr__(self):
                 return "Account Balance: {}".format(self._balance)
            def deposit(self, amount):
                #your code goes here
                self._balance += amount
        acc = BankAccount(0)
        acc.deposit(int(input()))
        print(acc)
        
    Static Methods
    Complete the given code to define a static add() method for the Calculator class, which returns the sum of its parameters.
    The code takes two numbers as input, and should return their sum using the Calculator class's add() method.
    Static methods can be called without creating an object of the class.
        class Calculator:
            #your code goes here
            @staticmethod
            def add(a,b):
                return a+ b
        n1 = int(input())
        n2 = int(input())
        print(Calculator.add(n1, n2))

    Property Values
    Complete the provided code by creating an isEven property, which returns True if the value is even, and False if the value is odd.
        class Number:
            def __init__(self, num):
                self.value = num
        x = Number(int(input()))
        print(x.isEven) 
    Use the modulo operator % to check if the value is even or odd. The value is even if the remainder of dividing it by 2 is 0.
        class Number:
            def __init__(self, num):
                self.value = num
            @property
            def isEven(self):
                if self.value % 2 == 0:
                    return True
                else:
                    return False
            #your code goes here
        x = Number(int(input()))
        print(x.isEven)
        
    Juice Maker (PROJECT)
    You are given a Juice class, which has name and capacity properties.
    You need to complete the code to enable and adding of two Juice objects, resulting in a new Juice object with the combined capacity and names of the two juices being added.
    For example, if you add an Orange juice with 1.0 capacity and an Apple juice with 2.5 capacity, the resulting juice should have:
    name: Orange&Apple
    capacity: 3.5
    The names have been combined using an & symbol.
    Use the __add__ method to define a custom behavior for the + operator and return the resulting object.
        class Juice:
            def __init__(self, name, capacity):
                self.name = name
                self.capacity = capacity
            def __str__(self):
                return (self.name + ' ('+str(self.capacity)+'L)')
            def __add__(self,other):
                new_name = self.name + "&" + other.name
                new_capacity = self.capacity + other.capacity
                return Juice(new_name, new_capacity)
        a = Juice('Orange', 1.5)
        b = Juice('Apple', 2.0)
        result = a + b
        print(result)
        
_____ Regular Expressions _____

    Contacts Database
    We need to create a number formatting system for a contacts database.
    Create a program that will take the phone number as input, and if the number starts with "00", replace them with "+".
    The number should be printed after formatting.
    Sample Input
    0014860098
    Sample Output
    +14860098
        import re
        #your code goes here
        num = input()
        num = re.sub(r"^00","+",num)
        print(num)

    Start With Ends With
    Write a program that takes a word as input, and outputs "Match" if the word has 4 letters, starts with "m" and ends with "e".
    The program should output "No match" if these mentioned requirements aren't satisfied.
    Sample Input
    mine
    Sample Output
    Match
    Don't forget to mention the start and end of the regular expression.
        import re
        word = input()
        #your code goes here
        pattern = r"m..e"
        if re.match(pattern, word):
            print("Match")
        else:
            print("No match")
            
    Online Shop Search
    All the products in online shop have their own ID. Every ID consists of 4 symbols:
    The first symbol: an uppercase character
    The second symbol: an uppercase character
    The third symbol: a digit
    The forth symbol: a digit
    Write a program for a search tool, that will take the ID as input and output "Searching" if the format is correct, and "Wrong format", if it's not.
    Sample Input
    LG17
    Sample Output
    Searching
    Remember to use $ sign in pattern to set the ending of the ID string.
        import re
        id = input()
        #your code goes here
        if re.search(r"[A-Z][A-Z][0-9][0-9]$", id):
            print("Searching")
        else:
            print("Wrong format")
            
    Authentication!
    Let's imagine we are creating our own authentication system.
    Create a program that takes a password as input and returns "Password created" if
    - it has at least one uppercase character
    - it has at least one number
    The Program should output "Wrong format" if requirements above are not met.
    Sample Input
    Hal44gb8
    Sample Output
    Password created
    Use metacharacter * that means zero or more repetitions.
        import re
        password = input()
        pattern = r"\w*[A-Z]\w*[0-9]\w*"
        #your code goes here
        if re.match(pattern, password):
            print("Password created")
        else:
            print("Wrong format")

    Social Media Pro
    You are a social media marketing specialist doing research on social networks.
    Write a program for your research that will take text as input and output all of the hashtags in it separately.
    Sample Input
    No #pressure, no #diamonds
    Sample Output
    #pressure
    #diamonds
    Remember that the re.findall() method returns a list of all substrings that match a pattern. So, you can use the regex r"#\w+" to find all words that start with a hashtag and output them on separate lines.
        import re
        text = input()
        #your code goes here
        #use re.findall() with r"#\w+" as the regex
        pattern = r'#\w+'
        search = re.findall(pattern,text)
        result = '\n'.join(search) #joins results with a newline
        print(result)
        
    Phone Number Validator (PROJECT)
    You are given a number input, and need to check if it is a valid phone number.
    A valid phone number has exactly 8 digits and starts with 1, 8 or 9.
    Output "Valid" if the number is valid and "Invalid", if it is not.
    Sample Input
    81239870
    Sample Output
    Valid
    You can use a regular expression to check if the input matches the given pattern.
        import re
        #your code goes here
        pattern = r"^[189][0-9]{7}$"
        if re.match(pattern, input()):
            print("Valid")
        else:
            print("Invalid")

_____ Pythonicness & Packaging _____

    Infinite Sum
    Given a function that takes 2 arguments and returns their sum.
    But we get an error when we want to sum more than 2 numbers. Change the function and complete the code so that the function sums as many numbers as are input.
    *args are accessible as the tuple args in the body of the function, so you can iterate through its items.
        #change the function
        def adder(x, *args):
            print(x+sum(args))
        adder(2, 3)
        adder(2, 3, 4)
        adder(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
        
    Give Me My Money
    You are given a program for a bank card withdrawal system: it takes the account and the amount that the user wants to withdraw, then outputs the remaining money. If the requested cash is greater than the balance, the program outputs "Error".
    The bank wants to set a minimal value of $500 for withdrawal. Modernize the program so that it will output the same "Error" if the requested money is less than $500.
    Sample Input
    4500
    300
    Sample Output
    Error
    As with other operators, you can chain multiple conditions with the ternary operator.
        balance = int(input())
        to_cash = int(input())
        #change the code
        money_left = balance-to_cash if to_cash<=balance and to_cash>=500 else "Error"
        print(money_left)
        
    Too Young To Ride
    The carousel is designed for 3 people who are each at least 16 years old.
    You are given a program that takes all 3 passengers' ages as inputs and inserts them in a list. Complete the program so that if it finds a value less than 16, it breaks the loop and outputs "Too young!".
    If the age requirement is satisfied, the program outputs "Get ready!".
    Sample Input
    18
    26
    19
    Sample Output
    Get ready!
    With the while loop, the code within the else block is called if the loop finishes normally, so that's where you need to output the "Get ready!" message.
        ages = []
        i = 0
        while i<3:
            age = int(input())
            ages.append(age)
            if min(ages) < 16:
                print("Too young!")
                break
            i+=1
        else:
            print("Get ready!")

    Adding Word (PROJECT)
    You need to write a function that takes multiple words as its argument and returns a concatenated version of those words separated by dashes (-).
    The function should be able to take a varying number of words as the argument.
    Sample Input
    this
    is
    great
    Sample Output
    this-is-great
    Recall, using *args as a function parameter enables you to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to that function.
        def concatenate(*args):
            return '-'.join(args)
        print(concatenate("I", "love", "Python", "!"))
