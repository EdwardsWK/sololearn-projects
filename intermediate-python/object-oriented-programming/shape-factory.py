"""Shape Factory

    We are improving our drawing application. Our application needs to support adding and comparing two Shape objects.
    Add the corresponding methods to enable addition + and comparison
    using the greater than > operator for the Shape class.

    The addition should return a new object with the sum of the widths and heights of the operands,
    while the comparison should return the result of comparing the areas of the objects.
