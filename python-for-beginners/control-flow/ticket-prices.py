"""Ticket Prices

    You are making a ticketing system.
    The price of a single ticket is $100.
    For children under 3 years of age, the ticket is free.

    Your program needs to take the ages of 5 passengers as input and output the total price for their tickets.

    Sample Input
    18
    24
    2
    5
    42

    Sample Output
    400

    There is one child under 3 among the passengers, so the total price of 5 tickets is $400.
"""

total = 0
i = 1

while i <= 5:
    age = int(input("Enter an age: "))
    if age > 3:
        total = total + 100
    i += 1

print(total)
